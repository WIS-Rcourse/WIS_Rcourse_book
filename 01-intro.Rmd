# Introduction {#intro}

## What will this course be about?

This will be an introductory course to programming in R and biological data
analysis. We will learn to load data into R, mainly from tables but also 
biologically oriented data formats such as FASTA files. It is primarily directed
to graduate students in the Life Sciences at the Weizmman Institute of Science
but open for auditors of neighboring institutions. There are no prerequisites
for the course, we will build from the most basic analysis concepts and
operations to the more complex ones throughout the course. We will not delve
deeply into the algorithmic nature of some tools, but rather focus on 
understanding the intuition and enable students to perform and understand
widely used analysis such as PCA, hierarchical clustering and linear regression.

## What is R and why learning R?

R is a programming language, and as such is at heart a way to give instructions 
to computers. It is widely used from academia to industry for its emphasis on 
statistics and graphics. R is also free software, and it is licensed under a
GNU General Public License, which allows its use even for commercial purposes 
without the need to pay a fee or usage license.

R is a quite popular language, currently ranks as 7th most popular language in the
world and 4th in the US, according to the [PYPL index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html).

But probably most important for us is, that many scientists, bioinformaticians, and software 
developers have organized to establish the [Bioconductor Project](https://bioconductor.org/).
A project which purpose is to develop R packages, code that extends R 
functionality, enabling a more straight-forward biologically-oriented data analysis. 

## Install R and Rstudio

To be prepared for the first class **it is mandatory that you install R and Rstudio**
(a development environment for R) **before the classes start**.
Here we point you to the relevant web pages, but if needed you will find tons of
online material elsewhere (YouTube ;) ) on the step-by-step installation process.

1. To install R head to the [R-project's web page](https://www.r-project.org/)
click **download R**. Choose a mirror location close to you for a faster download,
but any will do. Then choose between operative systems. R runs in Mac, 
Windows and most UNIX-like environments. Read and follow the instructions in site.
2. To install RStudio head to their [download web site](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download),
download and install the relevant version for your computer's OS.

You should **first** install R and only then install Rstudio. Rstudio will look 
for your R installation, if it is not already there you will have to configure it 
afterwards, which can be troublesome.

Hopefully you are not yet intimidated, don't be afraid. If you run into
troubles that cannot solve contact the Teaching Assistants, they'll be glad to 
help you out. See you in the next chapter and class!
