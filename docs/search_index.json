This book will be a companion text for the course ‘Principles and practice of large scale data analysis using R’ taught at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Lecturers Emmanuel Levy Schraga Schwartz Igor Ulitzky Teaching Assistants Miguel García Yaara Finkel Hugo Schweke Former TAs Benjamin Dubreuil Contributing to the book Students are encouraged to contribute to the book giving feedback and proposing changes through the use of the disqus comments section at the bottom of each chapter, and through git pull requests by forking the book’s GitHub Repository. Note:Even if you are experienced with git and programming, consider writing us some lines in the comments section before investing a lof of time in the whole process of forking, editing, and pull requesting. Let’s talk! "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Let’s make a short introduction for BEFORE the first class. Outline: A brief definition of programming and programming language. Why would you want to learn programming, and specifically using R. How to install R and Rstudio. Rstudio IDE The R console: Writing your first lines of R code. The text editor: Saving your code. Other windows and tabs: Environment, Files, Plots, and Help. Saving your code, objects and session. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway. This is an example of how to make a fiure with captions and other parameters. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(iris, col = iris$Species, main = &quot;The iris dataset&quot;, pch = 16) Figure 2.1: The iris dataset. Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). Bibliography is saved on .bib files in the main directory, in this case packages bibliography is created on the “packages.bib” file. References "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
