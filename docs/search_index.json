This book will be a companion text for the course ‘Principles and practice of large scale data analysis using R’ taught at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Lecturers Emmanuel Levy Schraga Schwartz Igor Ulitzky Teaching Assistants Miguel García Yaara Finkel Hugo Schweke Former TAs Benjamin Dubreuil Contributing to the book Students are encouraged to contribute to the book giving feedback and proposing changes through the use of the disqus comments section at the bottom of each chapter, and through git pull requests by forking the book’s GitHub Repository. Note:Even if you are experienced with git and programming, consider writing us some lines in the comments section before investing a lof of time in the whole process of forking, editing, and pull requesting. Let’s talk!

This will be an introductory course to programming in R and biological data analysis. We will learn to load data into R, mainly from tables but also biologically oriented data formats such as FASTA files. It is primarily directed to graduate students in the Life Sciences at the Weizmman Institute of Science but open for auditors of neighboring institutions. There are no prerequisites for the course, we will build from the most basic analysis concepts and operations to the more complex ones throughout the course. We will not delve deeply into the algorithmic nature of some tools, but rather focus on understanding the intuition and enable students to perform and understand widely used analysis such as PCA, hierarchical clustering and linear regression. 2.2 What is R and why learning R? R is a programming language, and as such is at heart a way to give instructions to computers. It is widely used from academia to industry for its emphasis on statistics and graphics. R is also free software, and it is licensed under a GNU General Public License, which allows its use even for commercial purposes without the need to pay a fee or usage license. R is a quite popular language, currently ranks as 7th most popular language in the world and 4th in the US, according to the PYPL index. But probably most important for us is, that many scientists, bioinformaticians, and software developers have organized to establish the Bioconductor Project. A project which purpose is to develop R packages, code that extends R functionality, enabling a more straight-forward biologically-oriented data analysis. 2.3 Install R and Rstudio To be prepared for the first class it is mandatory that you install R and Rstudio (a development environment for R) before the classes start. Here we point you to the relevant web pages, but if needed you will find tons of online material elsewhere (YouTube ;) ) on the step-by-step installation process. To install R head to the R-project’s web page click download R. Choose a mirror location close to you for a faster download, but any will do. Then choose between operative systems. R runs in Mac, Windows and most UNIX-like environments. Read and follow the instructions in site. To install RStudio head to their download web site, download and install the relevant version for your computer’s OS. You should first install R and only then install Rstudio. Rstudio will look for your R installation, if it is not already there you will have to configure it afterwards, which can be troublesome. Hopefully you are not yet intimidated, don’t be afraid. If you run into troubles that cannot solve contact the Teaching Assistants, they’ll be glad to help you out. See you in the next chapter and class!
