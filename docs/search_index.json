["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Let’s make a short introduction for BEFORE the first class. Outline: A brief definition of programming and programming language. Why would you want to learn programming, and specifically using R. How to install R and Rstudio. Rstudio IDE The R console: Writing your first lines of R code. The text editor: Saving your code. Other windows and tabs: Environment, Files, Plots, and Help. Saving your code, objects and session. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway. This is an example of how to make a fiure with captions and other parameters. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(iris, col = iris$Species, main = &quot;The iris dataset&quot;, pch = 16) Figure 2.1: The iris dataset. Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). Bibliography is saved on *.bib files in the main directory, in this case packages bibliography is created on the “packages.bib” file. References "],
